== INSTALLATION ==

1. Copy the folders `yet-another-related-posts-plugin` and `yarpp-templates` into the directory `wp-content/plugins/`.

2. Activate the plugin.

3. Find the Related Posts (YARPP) settings page in your `wp-admin`. If you see a message telling you to build your cache, please build your cache. Otherwise, you will see no related posts anywhere.

4. (optional) If you run a relatively low-traffic site (=most blogs), it is recommended that you enable the "compute related posts on the fly" option at the bottom of the Related Posts (YARPP) settings page.
